I'm a computer science student at [University of Costa Rica](https://www.ucr.ac.cr/).

My interests are programming language design and history, functional programming, type systems, and compilers. My favorite programming languages are Python and Haskell :)

My hobbies include calligraphy, reading, walking and tinkering with creative coding software, like [pure data](https://puredata.info/) and [processing](https://processing.org/). 

## Experience

I've worked as a learning facilitator at [Aprender Haciendo](http://www.aprenderhaciendo.co.cr/) since March 2013. We teach kids mechanics and programming with LEGO Education kits and methodologies and also train teachers in using them in their classrooms. Our goal is to transform education with innovative solutions to improve the students' integral development.

I've done some web development, but nothing big. I'd love to get more software developer experience, so if you have an offer I'm all ears ;)
